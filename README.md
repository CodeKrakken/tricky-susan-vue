# trickysusan
Promotional website for the band Tricky Susan, built with Vue.js and hosted at www.trickysusan.co.uk <br><br>
See also <a href="https://github.com/CodeKrakken/trickysusan-backend">trickysusan-backend</a>, as it contains backend elements that could not be hosted and therefore had to be removed.
